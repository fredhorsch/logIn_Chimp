# This is my Login for chimp

## About the Website

With this Code I symbolise a very simple Login process. 

## Technologies

Python, Flask, Jsonify

## Get it running locally

Required: 

A code editor like Visual Studio to have a look at the code. 
To start the code you have to download it from Github und save it on a folder, which you can find easily. 
By using the terminal with the comands ls and cd you can find the folder and start the programm with the following comand (python3 -m flask --app hello run).
The programm is running now. To stopp the programm press CTRL + C. 

To send commands you need an API Client. I use the open source API client insomnia. With insomnia you can quickly and easily send REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and GRPC requests directly. 

With insomnia und can go on the localy URL of the Login (http://127.0.0.1:5000/login) and by sending the following login or produce an error:

{
	"username": "frederic",
	"password": "123"
}

To check you can change the username or password. With this username and password you can login and will get the answer "ok".
